# Workday Calc

This is a small website utility that helps me to keep track of when I'm done my work day. 

It's 200 lines of code, including configuration and uses bootstrap with petit-vue from a cdn.

It's available here: https://m9p909.github.io/8-hour-work-day-calc/ 

Please raise an issue if any of the cdn's change or stop working.
